### How to start off

This website is built using the [Argon Framework](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-design-system). Feel free to fork and make it yours.

### How to deploy

Static websites can be directly hosted via github, but if you want to have a custom domain name you need to purchase it and connect it to your repo. 
Following guides would help you to do exactly that.

### How to write the Bio

It is important to get the Bio on your landing page spot on. If you are not sure how to get started, look for inspiration. The place you should look for can vary depending on your field.

1. If you are in the research field, look for personal websites in teh leading research groups.
2. If you are in the industry(let's say software engineering). You can check Github or LinkedIn to find potential people, then check their websites.
